In this challenge, I built a basic retail discount engine using JavaScript conditionals and loops. This tool will simulate pricing decisions based on customer types, product inventory levels, and promotional categories. 
I practiced decision-making using if, else if, and switch statements, then use loops to cycle through customer orders and inventory updates.
